# Temperature-prediction-machine-learning-model
This project focuses on predicting temperature values based on historical weather data and other environmental factors. By applying machine learning techniques, the model learns patterns from past data and forecasts future temperatures with improved accuracy.

[implemented by Scikit-learn]

Summary
Predicted daily temperature using multiple Linear Regression models & MLP with Scikit-learn, score = 0.85
Goal:
Using public local weather station data (San Jose) from NOAA (National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration) to predict temperature for the next 24 hours by using
different Machine Learning Algorithms

Raw Data:
NOAA weather data of San Jose weather station (2007.01.01 - 2016.12.31)

ML Algorithms (Scikit-learn):
linear_model.LinearRegression
linear_model.Lasso
linear_model.Ridge
neural_network.MLPRegressor
